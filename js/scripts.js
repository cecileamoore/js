// Create a “cheat sheet” JavaScript file that contains examples of all of the things we learned today, delineated with comments:


// Variables
	//In JavaScript, a variable is simply a container for a value
		//var name = ""
		//var numberOfCars = ""

// Debugging (alerts, comments, the console)

	//comments: 
		// for single line

		/*for
		multiple
		lines*/

	//console: built-in tood in browser to fun JavaScript code directly
	//alerts: 'pop-ups', output appears as soon as the alert () function is called
		//alert can be in console or in a scirpt (a .js file)

// Different data types
	
	//String - "Hello World"
	//Number - 5,5.5,1000(all numbers in JS are floats)
	//Boolean - true, false
	//Underfined (no value)

// Arrays
	//used to hold a collection of data, any data type
		//ex: ["Moe", "Larry", "Curly"]
		//can also combine data types: [1,3,5,7,"female", "male"]

// Testing
	//use this to test:
		/* function myFunction (){
			var obj = document.getElementById("h01");
			obj.innerHTML = "Hello jQuery";
		}
		onload = myFunction;

// Logic
	//logical operators used to determine logic between variables/values
		//Logical AND (&&)
		//Logical OR (||)
		//Logical NOTE (!)

// Functions
	//block of code used to preform a task, executed when invokes

// Write 3 different functions that take input and return something via the console or an alert
